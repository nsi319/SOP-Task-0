"What came first? Egg or chicken or egg or chicken...."
Heard this question a million times and got my head spun even more.
When I was younger I surely thought its a mind boggling question with a never ending answer.Just like a circle this is meant to go on and on.
But now when I think of it, 2 white parents can surely give a black child. This means that chicken  is an evolved species 
out of some other organism. Considering 2 such non-chicken beings mated, and due to genetic alterations the genes inside the egg
fused in a weird way, creating a chicken egg from 2 non-chicken organisms. 
Now if you say that chicken came first, and since we now know chicken comes from an egg, the only possible way
a chicken could have come first is if it was dropped from heaven.Its more likely that God dropped an egg from the 
heaven and not a chicken and that is why we say egg "cracks" and chicken is "born". 
If this is all too complicated just know that we have eggs for breakfast and chicken for dinner, and hence egg comes first :).
