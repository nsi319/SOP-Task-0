Eggs came first because when god created living creatures from his lab which might be in heaven above our world, 
he should bring them down from heaven to ground. To do so, he should have dropped them from sky because there 
were no rockets or parachute at that time. So if he dropped a living chicken, it would have obviously died. 
Hence instead he dropped the eggs so that it would break open upon falling and BOOM chickens started grazing 
on the ground.
