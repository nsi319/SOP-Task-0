Egg
Actually, egg laying animals existed far before chickens came about as first landed egg is 340 million years ago. so it is better worded as is it the chicken or the chicken egg. Research suggest that the protein essential for the formation of the chicken eggs (ov-17) is only formed in chicken ovaries, without it the chicken egg shell could not be formed. So, without a chicken, you technically can't get a chicken egg. This depends on the nature and definition of a chicken egg in first place. During Reproduction, 2 organism pass along thier genetic information of thier DNA, but the replication of their DNA is never 100% accurate and often produces minor changes for the new organism. This small mutation created thousands og species, but these genetic mutation must occur in the zygote cell. Let say, a proto-chicken, mated with another proto-chicken and bcoz of small genetic mutation, created the first chicken, which grew in an egg. So EGG came first.

                           git will move you to that branch, off the master.branch.
gedit <filename>- open a file and you can save changes.
